		If I die young, bury me in satin
		Lay me down on a bed of roses
		Sink me in a river at dawn
		Send me away with the words of a love song

		Uh oh, uh oh

		Lord make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
		She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors, oh,
		And life ain't always what you think it ought to be, no
		Ain't even grey, but she buries her baby

		The sharp knife of a short life, oh well
		I've had just enough time

		If I die young, bury me in satin
		Lay me down on a bed of roses
		Sink me in the river at dawn
		Send me away with the words of a love song

		The sharp knife of a short life, oh well
		I've had just enough time

		And I'll be wearing white, when I come into your kingdom
		I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger,
		I've never known the lovin' of a man
		But it sure felt nice when he was holdin' my hand,
		There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever,
		Who would have thought forever could be severed by...
		
		...the sharp knife of a short life, oh well?
		I've had just enough time

		So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearls
		What I never did is done

		A penny for my thoughts, oh, no, I'll sell 'em for a dollar
		They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
		And maybe then you'll hear the words I been singin'
		Funny when you're dead how people start listenin'

		If I die young, bury me in satin
		Lay me down on a bed of roses
		Sink me in the river at dawn
		Send me away with the words of a love song

		Uh oh (uh, oh)
		The ballad of a dove (uh, oh)
		Go with peace and love
		Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket
		Save 'em for a time when you're really gonna need 'em, oh

		The sharp knife of a short life, oh well
		I've had just enough time

		So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearls.
