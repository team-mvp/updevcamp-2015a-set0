		<h1>Why CSI?</h1>
		<div class="row1">
			<p>I first heard about this org just last year. My friends and I decided to attend the appsor although I didn't have plans to actually be an applicant; 
			I had my heart set for another org then. In just a few days after that, I had a sudden change of heart and was able to convince myself to apply so I 
			went and clicked on the applicant form. Unfortunately, the said form no longer was accepting responses. :( I didn't feel much bad about it and decided 
			to apply the following sem. Unfortunately (again), they weren't accepting applicants! Tough luck!
			<br>This sem, I learned just how important experience is for my future employment. I joined my first hackathon (see picture) and even took a company exam
			recently for a possible internship. I knew these were still not enough and thought that what better way to gain the experience I need than here in CSI? 
			CSI is an org focused on developing real-world projects. Plus, my closest friends are already part of it! All the more motivation for me to join. :D</p>
